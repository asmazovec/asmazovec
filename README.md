# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Alexander Mazovec 


Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm a passionate .NET Core developer with a knack for full-stack development and a love for solving complex problems. My dream? To transition to a Go-centric tech stack!

## ðŸ’¼ What I Do

Currently, I'm working in the oil and gas industry, where I:

- Enhance and maintain a large-scale analytics system for land reserve monitoring and land plot agreements
- Implement new features and resolve architectural issues
- Work with geospatial data and complex geometric calculations
- Develop dynamic ORM queries and implement advanced filtering and sorting capabilities

## ðŸš€ Beyond the Day Job 

My passion for development extends beyond my professional role:

- I've been coding since high school and have led several personal projects on `Python` and `Go`
- I've led a development in team of 4 developers and 4 testers on [one of my projects](https://github.com/vpo-tusur)
- I'm enthusiastic about DevOps and love writing automation scripts on `Bash`, `Perl`, `Python` and others
- I enjoy integrating code quality checking tools and other nice CI practices into my own projects!
- I'm actively exploring `Go` and dreaming of integrating it into my primary development stack
- I train on [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/usesr/asmazovec) 

## ðŸŽ“ Education & Aspirations

I hold a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering (2019-2023), and am currently pursuing a master's degree in Software Product Line Engineering. My next goals? Doctoral studies and mastering `Go`!

## ðŸŒ± What I'm Learning

I'm currently diving deep into:

- Authorization and Authentication protocols: `OAuth2.0`, `JWT`, `OIDC`
- Backend Web Development on `Go`: [team-agile](https://github.com/asmazovec/team-agile)
- `WebSockets`

## ðŸŒŸ Let's Connect!

Feel free to explore my repositories and don't hesitate to reach out if you want to collaborate, chat about tech, or discuss the wonders of `Go`. **Happy coding**!
